“We are building a mobile-first AI education app called PrepMate AI using Expo + NativeWind + Appwrite.
Maintain clean, reusable code with comments, small functions, and atomic design pattern.
Each file must have one responsibility. Use consistent naming (camelCase for functions, PascalCase for components).
Avoid inline styles, use NativeWind classes.
If new folder or file needed, create it properly inside structure:
/app (screens), /components (UI), /services (API), /hooks (logic), /utils (helpers).”
